Hello, everyone!
My name is Luciano and I'm a 20 years old electrical engineering and Data Science/AI student. 
My interests in programming are Machine Learning, Fullstack Developing, AI and Data management.
I'm quite new to the programming/computer science world, but I'm looking forward to keep evolving as quick as possible!
Up to date, I have intermediate skills in C, VBA, Python. Apart from that, I have basic knowledge in SQL.
